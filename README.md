This a Sanguino third-party hardware add-on for the Arduino IDE.

To use it, simply create a folder named hardware inside your sketchbook directory 
and then create another folder inside that folder called avr.
Now move the sanguino directory inside that folder. The structure would look like this:

/hardware/avr/sanguino/etc.
